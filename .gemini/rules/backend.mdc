### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend service, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend
- Use Supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly.
